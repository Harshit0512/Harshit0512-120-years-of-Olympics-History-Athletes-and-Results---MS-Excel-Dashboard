# 120-years-of-Olympics-History-Athletes-and-Results---MS Excel Dashboard

Note - As a file is greater than 25mb I had converted the file in two zip files. One have dashboard and other have pivot table and charts. You have to download both the files then only it will work otherwise it wll not work on your system.

This is a historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games, including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. I take this data from Kaggle site. I Used MS Excel to make a dashboard for this data. This dataset provides an opportunity to ask questions about how the Olympics have evolved over time, including questions about the participation and performance of women, different nations, and different sports and events.  Then I had created some objectives and perform them with the help of pivot table, slicers, charts and graphs. I also used some images to get better understanding what data is about or what is it telling us at some places. Then connect each slicers with their respective chart so that whenever I select something from slicer the chart is changes automatically.
